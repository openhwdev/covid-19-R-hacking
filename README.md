R scripts to manipulate data from nytimes covid-19 repo and other sources

A gloabl pandemic started about 6 months ago.  The New York Times has git repository at
https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data.git tracking some Covid-19 data for the United States.

The offer use of the data for non-commercial purposes with attribution.  See their link for more
information and specifics.  

Several Musings:

1) Thanks to all the health workers, scientists, grocery clerks and operators and too many others to mention
   for all you do.  There are lots of heros out there. Sorry to the people that have been hurt by the pandemic. 
2) Other than being a subscriber of the NY Times, there is currently no other affiliation with them.
   I like their graphics and Covid-19 information.  Furthermore, I am glad they put the data into a public
   git repository(or repo) for short. 
3) I'm an R idiot.  Everything is provided AS-IS with no warrenty or any expectations. 
4) Thanks to the R community for providing a great tool. I dabble with it. The manipulation of Covid-19 case
   data is important to attempt to comprehend what happening. While far from perfect, it's way better then a void.

That's all for now.
